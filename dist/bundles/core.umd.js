 * AnimationBuilder is an injectable service that is available when the {\@link
 * BrowserAnimationsModule BrowserAnimationsModule} or {\@link NoopAnimationsModule
 * NoopAnimationsModule} modules are used within an application.
 *
 * The purpose if this service is to produce an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * angular component or directive.
 *
 * Programmatic animations are first built and then a player is created when the build animation is
 * attached to an element.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // remember to include the BrowserAnimationsModule module for this to work...
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '\@angular/animations';
 *
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first build the animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // then create a player from it
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When an animation is built an instance of {\@link AnimationFactory AnimationFactory} will be
 * returned. Using that an {\@link AnimationPlayer AnimationPlayer} can be created which can then be
 * used to start the animation.

 * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])
 * ```

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by
 * default when an array is passed as animation data into {\@link transition transition}.)
 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once each of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * To perform animation styling in parallel with other animation steps then have a look at the
 * {\@link group group} animation function.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `sequence` animation function can either consist of
 * {\@link style style} or {\@link animate animate} function calls. A call to `style()` will apply the
 * provided styling data immediately while a call to `animate()` will apply its styling data over a
 * given time depending on its timing data.
 *

 * sequence([
 *   style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *   animate("1s", { opacity: 1 }))
 * ])

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })

 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)

 * being animated and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```
 *

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of

 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once
 * the state has been reached.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // "void" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent
 * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.
 * state("void", style({ height: 0 }))
 *
 * // user-defined states
 * state("closed", style({ height: 0 }))
 * state("open, visible", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ])
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])

     * <span class="informal">Use it when you have all these Observables, but still nothing is happening.</span>
     *
     * `subscribe` is not a regular operator, but a method that calls Observable's internal `subscribe` function. It
     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is
     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling
     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often
     * thought.
     *
     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values
     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two
     * following ways.
     *
     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods
     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create
     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do
     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also
     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't
     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will
     * be left uncaught.
     *
     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.
     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent
     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,
     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,
     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes
     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.
     *
     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.
     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean
     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback
     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.
     *
     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.
     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}
     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable
     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>
     * const sumObserver = {
     *   sum: 0,
     *   next(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);
     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;
     *   },
     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,
     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.
     *   complete() {
     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);
     *   }
     * };
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.
     * .subscribe(sumObserver);
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // "Adding: 1"
     * // "Adding: 2"
     * // "Adding: 3"
     * // "Sum equals: 6"

     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>

     * .subscribe(

 *
 * <img src="./img/combineLatest.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as
 * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,
 * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent
 * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,
 * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order
 * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable
 * on the first place and so on).
 *
 * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables
 * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of
 * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables
 * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that
 * completes immediately.
 *
 * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will
 * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,
 * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits
 * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last
 * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but
 * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without
 * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from
 * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does
 * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit
 * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some
 * value.
 *
 * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables
 * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined
 * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of
 * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case
 * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last
 * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`
 * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.
 *
 * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes
 * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.
 * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable
 * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array
 * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined
 * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>
 * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now
 * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now
 * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);
 * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0] after 0.5s
 * // [1, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 1] after 1.5s
 * // [2, 1] after 2s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>
 * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(
 *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds
 * );
 * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);
 * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0, 0] immediately
